* Image to PDF

It's easy to write such a tool yourself in most programming languages. There's also [[https://pypi.org/project/img2pdf/][img2pdf]].

The same can be achieved easily with [[https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/bionic/man1/pdfunite.1.html][pdfunite]] and similar tools. Ghostscript is available for almost all operating systems.
