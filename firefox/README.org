* User Preferences

The =user.js= file contains few default settings for Firefox:
- Visit the URL =about:support= in Firefox.
- Search for =Profile Folder=.
- Drop the =user.js= file inside the directory identified in the previous step.

* Tabs colors

It's become very difficult to identify quickly the active tab in Firefox. This is fixed in the =user.js= file so that we can override colors via CSS.

Copy the entire =chrome= directory inside your Firefox profile folder, same folder as for *User Preferences* in the previous section.

* Addons

Couple of useful addons that you can install.
